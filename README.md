gtk3-perl-demos
===============

gtk3-perl is the collective name for a set of Perl bindings for Gtk3 and various related libraries.
These modules make it easy to write Gtk3 applications using a natural, Perlish syntax.

The files in this package are demos made mostly from re-writing the demos from the gtk2-perl package,
as well as some from other sources.  These files serve to not only give other gtk3-perl writers some
examples from which to work, but also to help ensure the main Gtk3.pm module works as intended.
